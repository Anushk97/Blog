I recently took part in a Hackathon which was about developing solutions for Urban mobility in Singapore.
Urban mobility involves public transport, private cars, bikes, and other vehicles. It involves traffic flow and public services like MRT. 

## Business Problem
Use LLMs to help traffic planners respond better in case of an accident, a line breakdown or unforeseen situations like fire or traffic jam. 

Currently the decision making in these scenarios are not driven by data but by intuitive understanding of different areas in Singapore, such as where is the nearest fire station from the point of incident or nearest hospital in the area. 

Using LLM on the dataset collected by the Land and Transport Authority (LTA) in Singapore can help making these decisions more effective in stressful situations. 

## Approach and Dataset
While coming up with the solution, my team first studied the dataset collected by LTA. They maintain both dynamic and static datasets which can be used by researchers or developers. 
#### Dynamic datasets 
- Approved road works and faulty traffic lights
- Bus routes and bus arrival
- Bus Service
- ERP rates
- Passenger volumns by train stations and bus stops 
and more...

#### Static datasets
- Annual age distribution of buses
- Annual Estimated Mileage for Private Motor Vehicle
- Annual Motorcycle Population by Make
- Annual Motor Vehicle Population by Type of Fuel Used and more...
